# Getting started

## Installation

**gossipy** is available as a [PyPI](https://pypi.org) module and it can be installed using `pip`:

```console
$ pip install gossipy-dfl
```

## Introduction

**gossipy** is a python module created for research purposes and designed to be used by researchers
and developers. It is thought to be easy-to-use and easy-to-extend.

This framework provides a set of tools for simulating gossip learning and decentralized 
federated learning algorithms. 

### Gossip Learning

Gossip Learning (GL) is a distributed (machine) learning methodology based on the idea of spreading
information to other nodes without the need of a centralized server. The name *gossip* is a reference
to the gossiping mechanism used in ad-hoc networks.

The goal of GL is to train a machine learning model on a data set distributed across several nodes
in a network while keeping the local data private.

In its simplest form, that we call here *vanilla*, the gossip learning framework can be summarized
as in the following algorithm:

The algorithm shows what happen on a single node, and we can highlight three important macro steps:
1.  **model initialization**: (line 1-2) the model is initialized and (potentially) trained on the
local data. This is a one time procedure;
2.  **gossiping**: (line 3-6) the model is repeatedly gossiped to other, usually selected at random,
nodes;
3.  **model update**: (line 7-9) given a just received model, the model is trained on the local data
and set as the new model. Usually, the model update is done by merging the local model with the
received model (merge-update). However, in it simplest form, the model update is done by replacing
the local model with the received model (replace-update).

## Setting up a simulation

**gossipy** allows to define a gossip learning simulation easily and quickly. The four main
components that needs to be set up are:
- a [DataHandler](): this is the object responsible to handle the dataset.
After the dataset is loaded in memory, the data handler manages the splitting of the dataset
into training and test sets:
- a [DataDispatcher](): this is the object responsible to dispatch the data across
the clients (i.e., the nodes of the network).
- [GossipNodes](): these are the nodes participating in the simulation. Each node own a model
that is created starting from a [ModelHandler]() prototype. The [ModelHandler]() is the object
responsible to handle the model training and evaluation.
- a [GossipSimulation](): this is the main object that runs the gossip learning
simulation. 


The following code snippets show how to set up a gossip learning simulation.

```{note}
The following example tries to reproduce one of the experiments reported in the paper

Ormándi, Róbert, István Hegedüs, and Márk Jelasity. ['Gossip Learning with Linear Models on
Fully Distributed Data'](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.2858). Concurrency and Computation:
Practice and Experience 25, no. 4 (February 2013): 556–571.
```

Let's start by loading the dataset.

```python
from gossipy.data import load_classification_dataset, DataDispatcher
from gossipy.data.handler import ClassificationDataHandler

X, y = load_classification_dataset("spambase", as_tensor=True)
y = 2*y - 1 #convert 0/1 labels to -1/1
```

Here, we loaded `spambase` dataset as PyTorch tensors. Now, we need a `DataHandler` and a
`DataDispatcher` to manage the distribution of the dataset across the nodes.

```python
data_handler = ClassificationDataHandler(X, y, test_size=.1)
dispatcher = DataDispatcher(data_handler, n=100, eval_on_user=False, auto_assign=True)
```

We fixed the test size to 10% of the dataset and we perform global evaluation on a separate test 
set, i.e., the nodes do not have local test sets. The number of nodes in the network is 100.
The `auto_assign` parameter is set to `True` because we want just to compute the random
assignment of the dataset to the nodes.

Gossip learning is based on peer-to-peer communication. Therefore, we need a to define the topology 
of the network. In this case, we use a fully connected network, thus a clique topology.

```python
topology = StaticP2PNetwork(num_nodes=dispatcher.size(), topology=None)
```

It is called *static* because the topology is fixed throughout the simulation. Before setting up the
simulation, we need to create the nodes participating in the simulation.

```python
model_handler = PegasosHandler(net=Pegasos(data_handler.size(1)),
                               learning_rate=.01,
                               create_model_mode=CreateModelMode.MERGE_UPDATE)

nodes = GossipNode.generate(data_dispatcher=data_dispatcher,
                            p2p_net=topology,
                            model_proto=model_handler,
                            round_len=100,
                            sync=False)
```

Gossip nodes are created using the [GossipNode.generate()]() method which 
generates a number of nodes (corresponding to the size of the network/assignment of the dispatcher)
starting from a prototype. The prototype is actually the model handler that represents the crucial
information of the node. Nodes are created with an incremental id starting from 0. The `sync` 
paramenter controls whether the nodes are synchronized or not. Synchronized nodes participate
exactly once every each round.

Now, we can set up the simulation: we set a round length of 100 time units, a PUSH propocol (i.e.,
nodes only send their model to other nodes), and we set to 10% the number of nodes considered during
each evaluation.

```python
simulator = GossipSimulator(
    nodes=nodes,
    data_dispatcher=data_dispatcher,
    delta=100,
    protocol=AntiEntropyProtocol.PUSH,
    sampling_eval=.1
)
```

Finally, we can run the simulation. To keep track of the progress of the simulation, we use a
[SimulationReport]() object that is attached to the simulation. A `SimulationReport` collects the
results and some useful information about the simulation (e.g., number of sent messages,
number of failed messages,...).

```python
report = SimulationReport()
simulator.add_receiver(report)
simulator.init_nodes(seed=42)
simulator.start(n_rounds=100)
```

Once the simulation is finished, we can access the report object and, for example, plot the 
results.

```python
plot_evaluation([[ev for _, ev in report.get_evaluation(False)]], "Overall test results")
```
